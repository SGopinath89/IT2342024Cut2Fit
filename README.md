Welcome to Cut2Fit!

This Fashion & Apparel Application is tailored to make a change in an enhanced way of handling and getting involved in Apparel Industry. 
As many people who are very much talented in tailoring (stitching) garments lack a platform to showcase their potential. 
Therefore, this ONGOING PROJECT stimulates the industry by bringing a new dimention of media platform with a unique aspect included, that is Generative AI!

NOTE: I'm on the process of developing the perfect Algorith for my important feature of this App. 
Therefore I have added the code snippets, while on process. GenAI File is not completed. So it may cause some bugs while running the complete Application.
This complete new idea of an app is a bit challenging and have so many complicated blocks of codes compiled together. Hope to finish it soon!
